## Overview

This template provides a production‑ready Nginx instance as a Monk runnable. You can:

- Run it directly to get a managed Nginx web server with sensible defaults
- Inherit it in your own runnable to serve static content, reverse proxy, or load balance traffic

Nginx is a high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. It's known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.

## What this template manages

- Nginx container (`nginx` image, configurable tag)
- Network services on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)
- Custom nginx.conf configuration
- Static content serving
- Reverse proxy capabilities

## Quick start (run directly)

1) Load templates

```bash
monk load MANIFEST
```

2) Run Nginx with defaults

```bash
monk run nginx/nginx
```

3) Customize configuration (recommended via inheritance)

Running directly uses the defaults defined in this template's `variables`. Configuration added with custom files will not affect this runnable unless you inherit it and override those files.

- Preferred: inherit and customize variables or files as shown below.
- Alternative: fork/clone and edit the `variables` in `nginx/nginx.yaml`, then `monk load MANIFEST` and run.

Once started, access Nginx at `http://localhost:80`.

## Configuration

Key variables you can customize in this template:

```yaml
variables:
  nginx-image-tag: "latest"           # container image tag  
  http-port: "80"                     # HTTP port (env: HTTP_PORT)
  https-port: "443"                   # HTTPS port (env: HTTPS_PORT)
  worker-processes: "auto"            # worker processes count
  worker-connections: "1024"          # connections per worker
```

Custom nginx.conf can be provided via the `files` section in the template. Static content and configuration files are typically mounted from the host or defined inline.

## Use by inheritance (recommended for apps)

Inherit the Nginx runnable in your application to create a reverse proxy or serve static content. Example:

```yaml
namespace: myapp
web:
  defines: runnable
  inherits: nginx/nginx
  files:
    nginx-conf:
      container: nginx
      path: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      contents: |
        events {
          worker_connections 1024;
        }
        http {
          upstream backend {
            server api:8080;
          }
          server {
            listen 80;
            location / {
              proxy_pass http://backend;
              proxy_set_header Host $host;
            }
          }
        }
api:
  defines: runnable
  containers:
    api:
      image: myorg/api
  connections:
    proxy:
      runnable: web
      service: nginx
```

Then run your application group:

```bash
monk run myapp/api
```

## Ports and connectivity

- Service: `nginx` on TCP port `80` (HTTP) and `443` (HTTPS)
- From other runnables in the same process group, use `connection-hostname("<connection-name>")` to resolve the Nginx host.

## Persistence and configuration

- Configuration files can be mounted via the `files` section in your runnable definition.
- Static content can be served by mounting host directories or defining inline content.
- SSL/TLS certificates should be mounted from the host or provided via secrets management.
- Logs are available via `monk logs` command or can be persisted to host volumes if needed.

## Features

- High-performance static file serving
- Reverse proxy with caching
- Load balancing (round-robin, least connections, IP hash)
- SSL/TLS termination
- HTTP/2 support
- WebSocket proxying
- URL rewriting and redirects
- Access control and rate limiting

## Use cases

Nginx excels at:
- Serving static websites and assets
- Reverse proxy for microservices
- Load balancing across application servers
- SSL/TLS termination
- API gateway
- Content caching


## Related templates

- Combine with application backends (Node.js, Python, PHP)
- Use `certbot/` or `traefik/` for SSL/TLS certificates
- Integrate with `prometheus-grafana/` for monitoring

## Troubleshooting

- Test nginx configuration syntax:

```bash
monk do nginx/nginx/test-config
```

- Verify Nginx is responding:

```bash
curl http://localhost:80
```

- For SSL/HTTPS setup, ensure certificates are properly mounted and paths are correct.
- If configuration changes don't take effect, ensure you've reloaded or restarted the container.
- Check logs:

```bash
monk logs -l 500 -f nginx/nginx
```
